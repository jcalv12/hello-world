Creating my first Repo in GitHub
I am very exctied to say this is my firest ever GitHub repo!!!

I cloned this repo to my local using HTTP and the Comand pallete
Then I spun off a new branch called practice
I want to push these changes back to my repo, then merge with the Master branch via a pull request

adding a few updates here, and will pull this down to my local to make more changes
